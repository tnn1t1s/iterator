## Overview

This project implements and analyzes CollatingIterator, an interface for merging multiple sorted Iterator<T> streams into a single sorted output stream. The implementation uses a binary min-heap to achieve O(N log k) time complexity where N is the total number of elements and k is the number of input iterators.

Key contributions:
- Formal correctness proof with loop invariants
- Comparative analysis of heap vs tournament tree vs linear scan
- Implementations in Java, C++, and Rust
- Comprehensive benchmarking framework
- CS500-level technical exposition
