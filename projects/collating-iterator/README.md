# Collating Iterator

**Generated**: 2025-10-25
**Problem**: K-way merge of sorted iterators

## ⚠️ Status: Clean Slate

**Stages 2-8 have been removed.**

**Reason:** The original problem specification prescribed the solution (O(N log k), heap-based) before any analysis was done. This "poisoned" all subsequent stages - they were justifying a predetermined answer rather than discovering it through research.

**Current State:** Stage 1 has been corrected to pose research questions instead of prescribing solutions. Ready for clean pipeline execution.

## Current Structure

- `01-specification/` - ✅ Formal problem definition with research questions (COMPLETE)
- `02-analysis/` - ⏳ PENDING - Algorithmic analysis and complexity discovery
- `03-design/` - ⏳ PENDING - Design selection and justification
- `04-implementation/` - ⏳ PENDING - Java implementation
- `05-testing/` - ⏳ PENDING - Test strategy and suite
- `06-benchmarks/` - ⏳ PENDING - Performance measurement framework
- `07-report/` - ⏳ PENDING - CS500-level technical report
- `08-validation/` - ⏳ PENDING - Consistency verification

## What Happened

### Original Flow (Contaminated)
1. Stage 1 said: "Use O(N log k) with heap" ❌
2. Stages 2-8: Justified why that's correct ❌
3. Result: No actual discovery, just post-hoc rationalization

### Corrected Flow (Clean)
1. Stage 1 now asks: "What is the optimal complexity?" ✅
2. Stage 2 will discover: "O(N log k) is the lower bound" ✅
3. Stage 3 will discover: "Heap achieves this optimally" ✅
4. Result: True research with genuine discovery

## Next Steps

Re-run the research pipeline with the corrected Stage 1:

```bash
# The pipeline will now:
# 1. Read Stage 1 questions (not prescriptions)
# 2. Discover optimal complexity through analysis
# 3. Compare design alternatives without bias
# 4. Implement the discovered optimal solution
# 5. Validate through benchmarking
```

## Problem Statement

From the original prompt:

> "We're going to come up with a variety of implementations of a CollatingIterator. It will be an interface that takes multiple Iterator<T extends Comparable<T>> as input. Each of the iterators passed in will have the guarantee that they return elements in the order implied by the comparator."

Stage 1 formalizes this and poses research questions to guide discovery.
