# Stage 10: Skills Scorecard

## Scoring Rubric

- **1-3**: Weak - Major gaps, incorrect application, would not pass review
- **4-6**: Competent - Basic application, some gaps, meets minimum bar
- **7-8**: Strong - Solid application, minor gaps, exceeds expectations
- **9-10**: Exceptional - Exemplary execution, could be teaching material

## Skills Assessment

### 1. problem_specification (Stage 1)

**Score: 8/10** - Strong

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Corrected from prescriptive to research-question format
- ✓ Avoids solution leak (no mention of O(N log k) or heap in spec)
- ✓ Poses genuine discovery questions
- ✓ Clear input/output contracts
- ✓ Iterator protocol specified

**Gaps**:
- Missing formal pre/postcondition notation
- No discussion of iterator mutation semantics
- Space complexity constraints not specified

**Justification**: Demonstrates understanding that spec should pose problems not prescribe solutions. Self-corrected after user feedback shows learning. Strong for interview setting.

---

### 2. algorithmic_analysis (Stage 2)

**Score: 7/10** - Strong

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Correct lower bound proof (Ω(N log k) via decision tree)
- ✓ Space lower bound (Ω(k))
- ✓ Literature review before enumeration (TAOCP, CLRS)
- ✓ Found 4 optimal algorithms
- ✓ Identified loser tree variant after user hint

**Gaps**:
- No amortized analysis for heap operations
- Comparison count analysis theoretical only (not instrumented)
- Cache complexity hand-wavy
- No worst-case input construction

**Justification**: Solid theoretical analysis with correct bounds. Literature review was key to finding loser tree. Missing instrumentation to validate theory hurts score.

---

### 3. arxiv_research (Stage 2C)

**Score: 9/10** - Exceptional

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Found Grafana 2024 production use (critical modern validation)
- ✓ Identified Apache DataFusion benchmarks (50% speedup)
- ✓ Bridged gap between classical textbooks and cutting-edge practice
- ✓ Multiple query strategies attempted
- ✓ Documented lack of new sequential algorithms (validates classical approach)

**Gaps**:
- Could have searched for recent comparison count optimizations
- No search for production failure cases

**Justification**: Exactly what this skill should do - find modern production validation that textbooks lack. Grafana blog post was the key find that justified loser tree selection.

---

### 4. comparative_complexity (Stage 2-3)

**Score: 7/10** - Strong

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Systematic comparison table of 8 algorithms
- ✓ Clear identification of 4 optimal candidates
- ✓ Comparison count analysis (log k vs 2 log k)
- ✓ Cache locality trade-offs discussed
- ✓ Crossover point predictions (k=8-10)

**Gaps**:
- No quantitative cache model (just hand-waving)
- Predictions not empirically validated (benchmarks too limited)
- No sensitivity analysis (what if comparison is cheap?)

**Justification**: Good systematic comparison, but lacks empirical rigor to validate the constant factor claims.

---

### 5. systems_design_patterns (Stage 3)

**Score: 8/10** - Strong

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Production validation (Grafana 2024) as primary decision criterion
- ✓ Comparison count vs cache locality trade-off
- ✓ Knuth's preference cited (authoritative source)
- ✓ Discussion of when each algorithm wins
- ✓ Adaptive selection mentioned as future work

**Gaps**:
- No discussion of memory allocation patterns
- Thread safety not addressed
- No degradation strategies for production
- Monitoring/observability not considered

**Justification**: Strong design thinking with production validation. Knows when to trust battle-tested solutions. Missing operational concerns.

---

### 6. java_codegen (Stage 4)

**Score: 6/10** - Competent

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Three variants implemented (exactly right approach)
- ✓ One class per file (proper organization)
- ✓ Descriptive names, separate examples
- ✓ Proper package structure
- ✓ All implementations compile and run

**Gaps**:
- ✗ **CRITICAL BUG**: LoserTree refill() is O(k) not O(log k) (iterates all nodes)
- No comparison count instrumentation
- No error handling (assumes valid inputs)
- No thread safety mechanisms
- No primitive specializations

**Justification**: Multi-variant strategy is exemplary, file organization professional, BUT the loser tree bug is a red flag. Theory not validated against code. Competent implementation skills with critical gap in algorithmic correctness.

---

### 7. test_data_design (Stage 6)

**Score: 9/10** - Exceptional

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Systematic dimension analysis (k, N, distribution, pattern, exhaustion)
- ✓ 24 comprehensive test cases designed
- ✓ Predictions documented for each scenario
- ✓ Edge/adversarial/realistic cases identified
- ✓ TestDataGenerator with 4×4 pattern combinations
- ✓ Demonstrates methodology that distinguishes top candidates

**Gaps**:
- Generator not fuzz-tested itself
- No validation that generated data actually stresses claimed dimensions

**Justification**: Textbook-quality test data design. Shows exactly the systematic thinking interviewers want to see. Slight deduction for not validating the generator, but overall exceptional.

---

### 8. unit_test_generation (Stage 5)

**Score: 8/10** - Strong

**Evidence**:
- ✓ 70 tests, 0 failures
- ✓ Shared test base pattern (excellent design)
- ✓ Contract tests (hasNext consistency, exhaustion, remove)
- ✓ Correctness tests (parameterized)
- ✓ Edge cases (11 scenarios)
- ✓ Property tests (3 invariants)
- ✓ Ensures all variants pass identical tests

**Gaps**:
- No fuzz testing
- No mutation testing
- No coverage metrics reported
- Property tests basic (no QuickCheck-style generation)

**Justification**: Excellent test architecture (shared base is senior-level pattern). Good coverage of cases. Missing advanced testing techniques.

---

### 9. benchmark_design (Stage 6)

**Score: 5/10** - Competent

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Comprehensive JMH infrastructure designed
- ✓ Pragmatic decision (quick validation vs 40-min suite)
- ✓ Parameterized benchmarks ready
- ✓ Future work clearly documented
- ✓ Understands time constraints

**Gaps**:
- ✗ JMH benchmarks not actually run (only noisy quick benchmark)
- ✗ No statistical significance testing
- ✗ No comparison count validation (core thesis unproven)
- ✗ No cache miss measurements
- Quick benchmark results too noisy to validate anything

**Justification**: Design is solid, pragmatism is appropriate, BUT no actual rigorous results. Theory remains unvalidated. Competent design with weak execution.

---

### 10. self_consistency_checker (Stage 7)

**Score: 7/10** - Strong

**Evidence**:
- ✓ Systematic cross-artifact consistency checks
- ✓ Completeness audit (all stages present)
- ✓ Build system validation (gradle works)
- ✓ Identified warnings (noisy benchmarks, k=100 untested)
- ✓ Honest about limitations

**Gaps**:
- Didn't catch loser tree O(k) bug (critical miss)
- No automated checking (manual inspection only)
- No quantitative consistency metrics

**Justification**: Good systematic approach to validation. Honest about limitations. Major gap: missed the algorithmic bug that reviewer caught. Human review isn't enough for complex code.

**Mean Score**: 7.4/10
**Median Score**: 7.5/10

### Strengths

1. **Exceptional methodology**: test_data_design (9) and arxiv_research (9) show senior-level systematic thinking
2. **Strong theoretical foundation**: algorithmic_analysis (7), comparative_complexity (7), systems_design_patterns (8)
3. **Good test architecture**: unit_test_generation (8) with shared base pattern
4. **Self-awareness**: Honest about limitations, documented future work

### Critical Weaknesses

1. **Loser tree bug**: O(k) refill destroys algorithmic advantage - theory not validated against code
2. **Unvalidated thesis**: Comparison count claims never instrumented or measured
3. **Benchmark execution gap**: Designed comprehensive suite but didn't run it
4. **Production readiness**: No error handling, monitoring, thread safety

### Recommendation

**Overall Rating: 7.4/10 - Strong with Critical Gaps**

**Hire Decision: Conditional Hire - Technical Deep-Dive Required**

**Justification**:

The candidate demonstrates senior-level systematic methodology (exceptional test data design, strong literature review) and makes the right strategic choices (multi-variant implementation, pragmatic time management). The 8-stage pipeline shows ability to decompose complex problems.

However, the loser tree implementation bug is a **critical red flag** that suggests theory understanding without implementation validation. A senior engineer would instrument comparison counts to verify the 2× claim empirically. The gap between designed benchmarks and executed benchmarks raises questions about follow-through.

**Recommendation**: Advance to technical deep-dive with focus on:
1. Walk through loser tree code - can candidate spot the O(k) bug?
2. How would you instrument comparison counting?
3. Why didn't you run the full JMH suite? (Good answer: time constraints. Bad answer: didn't know how.)
4. Discuss production deployment - error handling, monitoring, SLOs

If candidate acknowledges gaps honestly and demonstrates debugging/instrumentation skills in real-time, **Hire**. If candidate defends buggy code or can't explain trade-offs, **No Hire**.

### Score Justification by Category

**Exceptional (9-10)**: 2 skills
- Shows what candidate does best: systematic methodology and modern research

**Strong (7-8)**: 6 skills
- Solid execution, minor gaps, generally exceeds mid-level

**Competent (5-6)**: 2 skills
- Meets minimum bar but has notable gaps that concern

**Weak (1-4)**: 0 skills
- No fundamental incompetence, but critical bug in java_codegen is borderline

The distribution (60% strong+, 20% exceptional) suggests a candidate who thinks like a senior but needs more rigor in validation and production concerns. With mentorship on instrumentation and operational thinking, could be strong senior hire.
