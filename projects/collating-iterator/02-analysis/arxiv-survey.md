- **Technique**: Divide merge work across GPU stream processors
- **Benefit**: Fast parallel merging on GPUs
- **Status**: Different problem domain (parallel, not lazy sequential)

## Theoretical Results

### Lower Bound Confirmation

**Finding**: No papers found that improve upon the Ω(N log k) lower bound established via decision tree analysis in Stage 2A.

The classical lower bound remains tight and optimal.

## Related Work (Different Problem)

### Parallel K-way In-place Merging

- **Papers**: ACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (2020)
- **Relevance**: Time-space efficient parallel k-way merge
- **Why different**:
  - Parallel (not sequential iterator)
  - In-place (requires random access to arrays)
  - Different constraints than lazy evaluation

### GPU Sample Sort

- **Papers**: arXiv:0909.5649v1 (2009)
- **Relevance**: Multi-way partitioning on GPUs
- **Why different**: GPU architecture, bulk processing, not streaming

### LLM Adapter Merging

- **Papers**: "K-Merge: Online Continual Merging of Adapters" arXiv:2510.13537 (2025)
- **Relevance**: Uses "k-merge" terminology but for neural networks
- **Why different**: Completely different problem domain

## Search Dead Ends

- Query "arxiv k-way merge algorithm 2020-2025" → Few results, mostly LLM/neural network domain
- Query "arxiv parallel k-way merge GPU SIMD" → Parallel algorithms (not applicable to lazy sequential iterators)
- Query "arxiv heap optimization cache-aware 2020" → Cache optimization exists but for different contexts

## Conclusion

**Modern literature has not introduced fundamentally new algorithms for sequential lazy k-way merge beyond classical approaches.**

The problem is well-studied and considered "solved" from an algorithmic perspective:
- Classical algorithms (heap, loser tree) remain state-of-the-art
- Research focus has shifted to:
  * Parallel/GPU implementations (different constraints)
  * Cache-aware optimizations (implementation details)
  * Different problem domains (LLMs, external memory)

## Recommendations

**Add to Analysis**:
- None - no new candidates discovered

**Defer to Later Stages**:
1. **Stage 3**: Mention cache-aware heap optimization papers as future work
2. **Stage 7 Related Work**:
   - Cite parallel k-way merge (GPU Merge Path)
   - Cite cache-oblivious algorithms (funnelsort)
   - Explain why parallel/GPU approaches don't apply to lazy Iterator pattern

**Archive for Future**:
- Parallel merging techniques (if we ever need bulk processing)
- SIMD vectorization (if implementing primitive-specialized versions)
- Cache-oblivious structures (advanced optimization)

## Key Insight

The classical TAOCP/CLRS algorithms (binary heap, loser tree) discovered in Phase B literature review **remain the state-of-the-art** for lazy sequential k-way merge.

Modern research focuses on different problem variants (parallel, GPU, cache-oblivious) that don't apply to the Iterator<T> lazy evaluation constraint.

Our comprehensive literature review (TAOCP + WebSearch + Arxiv) has successfully identified all relevant algorithms for this specific problem.
