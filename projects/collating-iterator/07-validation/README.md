# Stage 7: Validation

## Purpose

End-to-end validation of research artifact before presentation. Top candidates self-check their work for consistency, completeness, and quality.

## Validation Checklist

### 1. Cross-Artifact Consistency

#### Stage 3 Predictions ↔ Stage 6 Results

**Prediction 1**: Linear scan competitive for k ≤ 8
- Stage 3 (03-design/comparative-analysis.html): "Linear scan: Small k (≤8) competitive"
- Stage 6 quick results: k=3 shows all algorithms competitive
- **Status**: ✓ Consistent (quick benchmark noisy but validates infrastructure)

**Prediction 2**: Heap/tree 5-10× faster for k=50
- Stage 3: "O(N log k) algorithms significantly faster for medium k"
- Stage 6 quick results: k=50 shows heap 1.26× faster than linear
- **Status**: ⚠ Results noisy without JMH, but trend visible

**Prediction 3**: Loser tree ~2× faster than heap for k ≥ 100
- Stage 3: "Loser tree half the comparisons (log k vs 2 log k)"
