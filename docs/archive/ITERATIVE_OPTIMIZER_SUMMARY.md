# Iterative Optimizer Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Status**: âœ… Complete
**New Skill**: iterative_optimizer (Skill #19)

---

## What Was Built

### Core Skill: iterative_optimizer

**Purpose**: Act as relentless technical interviewer asking "Can you do better?" after every solution.

**Location**: `.claude/skills/CS500/iterative_optimizer/SKILL.md`

**Size**: ~17KB comprehensive skill definition

**Philosophy**: Never accept "good enough" - push to theoretical limits, then constant factors, then microarchitectural optimizations.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Challenge Framework

Generates 3-5 specific challenges per iteration across 5 escalation levels:

**Level 1**: Better Complexity Class
- O(nÂ²) â†’ O(n log n) â†’ O(n)

**Level 2**: Optimal Complexity, Better Constants
- n log n comparisons â†’ 0.95n log n comparisons

**Level 3**: Radical Rethinking
- "What if we don't sort at all?"
- "Randomization? Approximation? Parallel?"

**Level 4**: Microarchitectural
- Cache behavior, branch prediction, SIMD vectorization

**Level 5**: Theoretical Limits
- Prove lower bound or find better algorithm

### 2. Provocation Tactics

**Question Assumptions**:
- "Why sorted? Do you need full order?"
- "Why deterministic? Randomization breaks worst-case."
- "Why exact? Approximate is faster."

**Reframe Problem**:
- "Instead of sorting N, what if we select top-k?"
- "Instead of eager, what if lazy evaluation?"

**Literature Mining**:
- WebSearch for recent algorithms (2000-2002 era-appropriate)
- Cite findings: "Demaine 2002 shows..."

### 3. Stop Conditions (User-Controlled)

**Continue When**:
- Better algorithm exists (proven or suspected)
- Constant factors improvable
- No lower bound proven

**Consider Stopping When**:
- Lower bound proven and matched
- Literature confirms optimal
- User says "stop" (ultimate authority)

**Never Stop For**:
- "Good enough"
- "Standard solution"
- "Optimal in Big-O" (what about constants?)

### 4. Era-Appropriate Voice (1999-2002)

**Tone**: Demanding but fair
- "Good. Now make it fast."
- "You're at O(n log n). Can you do O(n)?"
- "Prove optimal or keep trying."

**Idioms**:
- "Hot path" not "critical path"
- "Cache misses are killing you"
- "Don't trust the JIT"
- "Measure, don't guess"

## Integration Points

### Standalone Mode
```
User: "Can we do better than O(nÂ²)?"
â†’ iterative_optimizer activates
â†’ Generates 5 challenges
â†’ User picks one, implements
â†’ "Can we do better?" repeats
```

### Pipeline Mode (Automatic)
```
"Research k-way merge with aggressive optimization"
â†’ research_to_code_pipeline runs Stages 1-2
â†’ Stage 2.5: iterative_optimizer auto-activates
â†’ "O(nk) found. Try O(n log k) with heap?"
â†’ Loop: User approves â†’ re-run Stage 2
â†’ Continue until user stops
```

### Trigger Keywords
- "can we do better?"
- "optimize"
- "find optimal"
- "aggressive optimization"

## Example Usage Session

### Example 1: Sorting Challenge

**Iteration 0**:
```
User: "Sort an array"
â†’ Solution: Bubble sort O(nÂ²)
```

**Iteration 1**:
```
User: "Can we do better?"
â†’ iterative_optimizer: "Merge sort O(n log n). Try it."
â†’ User implements merge sort
```

**Iteration 2**:
```
User: "Can we do better?"
â†’ iterative_optimizer: "Comparison-based lower bound Î©(n log n) proven. But for integers, radix sort is O(n). Try?"
â†’ User implements radix sort
```

**Iteration 3**:
```
User: "Can we do better?"
â†’ iterative_optimizer: "O(n) optimal for integers. But 8n passes with radix-256. Can we do 4n with radix-65536?"
â†’ User: "Stop, good enough"
```

### Example 2: K-Way Merge

**Iteration 0**:
```
User: "Merge k sorted lists"
â†’ Solution: Linear scan O(nk)
```

**Iteration 1**:
```
User: "Can we do better?"
â†’ iterative_optimizer: "Min-heap O(n log k). Factor k/log k speedup."
â†’ User implements heap
```

**Iteration 2**:
```
User: "Can we do better?"
â†’ iterative_optimizer: "Î©(n log k) lower bound. Optimal asymptotically. But tournament tree has log k comparisons vs 2 log k for heap. For k=100, that's 7 vs 14 compares."
â†’ User: "Not worth complexity. Stop."
```

## Design Principles Satisfied

Based on user requirements:

âœ… **Continue to constant factors**: Even at optimal O(), keeps pushing
âœ… **Radical rethinking**: Challenges assumptions, not just incremental
âœ… **Both modes**: Standalone + pipeline integration
âœ… **Focus on time complexity**: Primary axis (with hooks for others)
âœ… **Never stops**: User controls stopping, skill always has next challenge

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Algorithm Design
Find optimal algorithm starting from naive solution, iterating through improvements.

### 2. Code Review
Challenge existing implementations: "This is O(nÂ²). Can we do better?"

### 3. Research Exploration
Explore solution space exhaustively, document all alternatives considered.

### 4. Teaching
Demonstrate improvement process from naive to optimal, show thinking path.

### 5. Competitive Programming
Optimize solutions under pressure, find edge cases that trigger optimization.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
1. Test standalone activation: "Can we do better than bubble sort?"
2. Test pipeline integration: "Research merge with aggressive optimization"
3. Verify challenge quality and relevance

### Future Enhancements
1. Track optimization history in skill_context_cache
2. Generate optimization graphs (solution tree)
3. Compare multiple paths to optimality
4. Add domain-specific challenge patterns (graphs, strings, etc.)
